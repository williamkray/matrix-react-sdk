-          contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
-          in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective

-
-3. LICENSE GRANT
-
-   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
-   grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
-   duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
-   the Work as stated below:
-
-          a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
-          more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in
-          the Collections;
-
-          b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
-          Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
-          reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
-          identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
-          example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
-          translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
-          indicate "The original work has been modified.";
-
-          c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
-          incorporated in Collections; and,
-
-          d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. The above
-          rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
-          known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
-          to make such modifications as are technically necessary to
-          exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to
-          Section 8(g), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
-          hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set
-          forth in Section 4(h).
-
-4. RESTRICTIONS
-
-   The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
-   limited by the following restrictions:
-
-          a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under
-          the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
-          Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
-          copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
-          offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
-          this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
-          exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
-          the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
-          intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
-          disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
-          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
-          Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
-          measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
-          the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
-          recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
-          applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
-          does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
-          made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
-          Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
-          extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
-          required by Section 4(f), as requested. If You create an
-          Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
-          extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
-          required by Section 4(f), as requested.
-
-          b. Subject to the exception in Section 4(e), you may not
-          exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in
-          any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
-          commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The
-          exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
-          digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
-          intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
-          monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
-          monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of
-          copyrighted works.
-
-          c. If the Work meets the definition of Software, You may exercise
-          the rights granted in Section 3 only if You provide a copy of the
-          corresponding Source Code from which the Work was derived in digital
-          form, or You provide a URI for the corresponding Source Code of
-          the Work, to any recipients upon request.
-
-          d. If the Work is used as or for a Web Service, You may exercise
-          the rights granted in Section 3 only if You provide a copy of the
-          corresponding Source Code from which the Work was derived in digital
-          form, or You provide a URI for the corresponding Source Code to the
-          Work, to any recipients of the data served or modified by the Web
-          Service.
-
-          e. You may exercise the rights granted in Section 3 for
-          commercial purposes only if you statisy any of the following:
-
-                i. You are a worker-owned business or worker-owned
-                collective; and
-                ii.  after tax, all financial gain, surplus, profits and 
-                benefits produced by the business or collective are
-                distributed among the worker-owners
-		iii. You are not using such rights on behalf of a business
-		other than those specified in 4(e.i) and elaborated upon in
-                4(e.ii), nor are using such rights as a proxy on behalf of a
-                business with the intent to circumvent the aformentioned
-                restrictions on such a business.
-
-          f. Any use by a business that is privately owned and managed,
-          and that seeks to generate profit from the labor of employees
-          paid by salary or other wages, is not permitted under this
-          license.
-
-          g. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
-          Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
-          made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
-          for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
-          are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
-          pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
-          Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
-          a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
-          ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor!s copyright notice, terms of
-          service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
-          parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
-          extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
-          specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
-          not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
-          the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of
-          an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
-          Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
-          Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
-          Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(f) may be
-          implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
-          the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
-          will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
-          Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits
-          and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
-          other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
-          only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
-          attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your
-          rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
-          assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
-          by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
-          appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
-          separate, express prior written permission of the Original
-          Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
-
-          h. For the avoidance of doubt:
-
-                i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
-                jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
-                through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
-                cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
-                right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
-                the rights granted under this License;
-
-                ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
-                jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
-                through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can
-                be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
-                collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
-                rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such
-                rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
-                noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and
-                otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through
-                any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
-                iii.Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the
-                right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in
-                the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
-                society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
-                that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
-                granted under this License that is for a purpose or use
-                which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under
-                Section 4(b).
-
-          i. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as
-          may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
-          Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
-          part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
-          mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
-          the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
-          honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
-          (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
-          Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
-          would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
-          other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
-          honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
-          appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
-          the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
-          exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
-          make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
-
-5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER
-
-   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
-   OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
-   KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
-   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
-   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
-   LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
-   ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
-   THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
-   YOU.
-
-6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY
-
-   EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
-   LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
-   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
-   THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED
-   OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. TERMINATION
-
-          a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
-          automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
-          License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
-          or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
-          have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
-          entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
-          1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
-          License.
-
-          b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license
-          granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
-          copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor
-          reserves the right to release the Work under different license
-          terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
-          however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
-          License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
-          be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License
-          will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
-          stated above.
-

-
-          b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,

-          and/or URI of the corresponding Source Code on the same terms and

-
-          e. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
-          under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
-          enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
-          and without further action by the parties to this agreement,

-          to make such provision valid and enforceable.
-
-          f. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
-          and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall
